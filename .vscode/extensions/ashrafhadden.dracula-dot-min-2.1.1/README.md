Minimal üåô Dark & üîÜ Light themes for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)

- Flat
- Borderless
- All-one-color

Dracula.min is a minimal version of [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I was inspired by the beautiful seamless style of [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) which I fell in love with for its immersive feeling and distraction-free UI.

This has the added advantage of automatically including the latest [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) theme updates.

**Enable/Disable**: surround and `Toggle Block Comment` <kbd>‚áß</kbd> <kbd>‚å•</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd>

## Colors Used

## Light Theme Methodology

When I first attempted to create a Dracula Light theme I simply switched the background [`#282a36`](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme#color-palette) and foreground [`#f8f8f2`](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme#color-palette) colors to see what would hapen.

![Dracula.min Light (no contrast adjust) Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashrafhadden/dracula.min/master/screenshots/dracula-dot-min-light_no_contrast_adjust.png)

As it turns out, most dark theme colors only work for dark themes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When you only switch the background and foreground, the syntax hightlighting colors
are often left with very poor contrast. In the screenshot above, Yellow is nearly invisible.

### [Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs) to the rescue!

Thanks to the powerful color manipulation library [Chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js), I was able to darken all the syntax colors using it's [color.darken()](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#color-darken) method.

```js
currentColor = chroma(currentColor).darken(1.5);
```

![Dracula.min (darken equally) Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashrafhadden/dracula.min/master/screenshots/dracula-dot-min_darken_equally.png)

However as you can see, darkening all the syntax colors equally doesn't quite cut it. The yellows are still a bit too light and the file explorer selection highlight on the left is difficult to see. Darkening each color manually and checking by eye seemed like hard work üëÄ, so being the lazy programmer that I am, I decided to try and automate it!

#### [chroma.contrast()](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#chroma-contrast)

Using Chroma's [.contrast method](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#chroma-contrast) I was able to create a [`while` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) that darkened each syntax color indefinitely until it's contrast ratio reached 4.5. 4.5:1 is the WCAG's [_"Contrast (Minimum)"_](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) recommendation for text.

```js
while (chroma.contrast(currentColor, foregroundColor) < 4.5) {
    currentColor = chroma(currentColor).darken(0.001);
}
```

> While the contrast ratio between `currentColor` and `foregroundColor` is less than 4.5, darken the `currentColor` by 0.1%

Which results in [Dracula.min Light](#dracula.min-Light).

### Light Theme Darker

The WCAG also has a AAA or [_"Contrast (Enhanced)"_](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced) recommendation of 7:1. Using the same method as above we can do the following to create a slightly darker syntax variant of the Light Theme:

```js
while (chroma.contrast(currentColor, foregroundColor) < 7) {
    currentColor = chroma(currentColor).darken(0.001);
}
```

Which results in [Dracula.min Light Darker](#dracula.min-Light-Darker).
This provides an even darker color syntax for those who prefer it.
